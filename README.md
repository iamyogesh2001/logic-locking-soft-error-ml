# Logic Locking and Soft-Error Vulnerability
## An ML-Guided Framework for Reliability-Aware Key-Gate Placement in VLSI Circuits

> **Authors:** Yogesh Rethinapandian · Arun Karthik Sundararajan · Kaushik Kumar · Smrithi Prakash

## Overview

Logic locking is a widely used hardware IP protection technique that
inserts key-controlled gates into a circuit netlist. While existing
research focuses exclusively on the **security** properties of locking
schemes, this work asks a different question:

> *What happens to a circuit's soft-error vulnerability when you lock it?*

We present the **first systematic study** of the reliability
side-effects of logic locking. Using Monte Carlo fault injection across
all ten ISCAS-85 benchmark circuits under three locking schemes and
three key sizes, we show that **SDC rate varies by up to 23.2
percentage points** across placements of identical security strength.
We then propose an **ML-guided placement framework** that reduces SDC
rate by up to **26.5%** relative to random placement baselines, while
preserving equivalent SAT-attack resistance.

## Key Findings

| Finding | Result |
|---|---|
| Max SDC gap across identical security placements | **23.2 pp** (c499, XNOR locking) |
| Average SDC gap across all circuits and schemes | **6.8 pp** |
| Max SDC reduction by ML-guided placement | **26.5%** (c499) |
| Average SDC reduction vs. random placement | **11.1%** |
| Gate-level dataset size | **9,677 samples** |
| Total fault injection trials | **18,000,000** |

## Experimental Setup

### Benchmarks
All ten **ISCAS-85** combinational benchmark circuits:
`c432, c499, c880, c1355, c1908, c2670, c3540, c5315, c6288, c7552`

Gates range from **171** (c432) to **2,381** (c6288).
Loaded directly from the `circuitgraph` Python library — no external downloads needed.

### Locking Schemes
| Scheme | Description |
|---|---|
| **XOR** | XOR gate at selected node, key=0 passes signal |
| **XNOR** | XNOR gate at selected node, key=1 passes signal |
| **Mixed XOR/XNOR** | Gate type assigned by signal probability (SP>0.5 → XNOR) |

### Fault Model
Single-Event Upset (SEU) per **JEDEC JESD89A**: single bit-flip at a
randomly selected internal gate output for one evaluation cycle.

### Scale
- 3 schemes × 3 key sizes × 20 placements × 10 circuits = **1,800 locked variants**
- 10,000 Monte Carlo trials per variant = **18 million fault injection trials**
- Per-gate SDC labeling: 2,000 trials × 9,677 gates = **~19 million additional trials**
